# Sam Swinson

I am a seasoned IT professional with a huge backgroud of work in networking. Transitioning into a systems developer role my skillset has expanded from purely networking focused into a broader range of skills including enterpise system management, service design, enterprise monitoring and system development.

I an currently using a HomeLab to form the basis of my continuted IT knowledge attainment along with my full time job and studying for IT certifications.

I also run a website https://knowledgeaddict.co.uk/ - this is a more formal documentation of things I have learned/done.
